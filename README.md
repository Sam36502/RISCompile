# RISCompile
*A Compiler to write Assembly programs for my RISCI-64 VM*

**WARNING:**
Read my code at your own risk! This is all just hobby code that's mostly [bodged](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bodge)
together with no thought of maintenance. I am also still learning about some of the better methods of coding. If you notice some
odd or inefficient code, then just let me know, how I could have done it better. Thanks.
